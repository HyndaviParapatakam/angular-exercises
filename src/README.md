## Application Structure

### 2.1 Change Detection

- **Parent Component**
  - Button to change a name string
  - Button to add a new item (trigger change detection)
- **Child Component (OnPush)**
  - Receives `@Input()` props
  - Logs `ngOnChanges` and `ngDoCheck`
  - Uses a pure pipe (`PureUppercasePipe`) for name
  - Optimized rendering using `trackBy`

### 2.2 NgRx Shopping Cart

- State managed with **NgRx Store**
- Actions: `addItem`, `removeItem`, `updateQuantity`
- Selectors: `selectCartItems`, `selectCartTotal`, `selectCartCount`
- **Meta-reducer** to sync cart state with `localStorage`
- Responsive and modern UI with:
  - Input form (name, price, quantity)
  - List of items with editable quantity and remove button
  - Cart summary (total items, total price)
